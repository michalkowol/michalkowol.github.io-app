## Configuration

On Ubuntu configuration file is located in `/etc/samba/smb.conf`. You need `root` privileges to edit it.

### Sample file

```nohighlight
[global]
  workgroup = WORKGROUP
  server string = servername
  unix password sync = yes

[homes]
  comment = Home Directories
  browseable = no
  read only = no
  writable = yes
  guest ok = no
  create mask = 0600
  directory mask = 0700
  security = user

[accounting]
  comment = Accounting Department Directory
  writable = yes
  valid users = @account
  path = /media/storage/accounting
  create mask = 0660
  directory mode = 0770
  force group = account

[public]
  comment = Public
  browsable = yes
  path = /media/storage/public
  public = yes
  read only = no
  writable = yes
  guest ok = yes
  create mask = 0666
  directory mode = 0777
```

You need to set public storage directory permissions to be `777 (drwxrwxrwx)` and for directories shared in group `770 (drwxrwx---)`. Don't forget to change group of shared directories with `chown -R :groupname path`.

This is how we can create group `account` and add `bob` to `account`.

```bash
groupadd account
adduser bob
usermod -a -G account bob
smbpasswd -a bob

```

#### Configuring anonymous public shares

```nohighlight
[public]
  comment = Public
  browsable = yes
  path = /media/storage/public
  public = yes
  read only = no
  writable = no
  write list = bob
  guest ok = yes
```

This sets up a share named `public` which is shown when browsing the server to any user with rights to do so. You can see it is public, but not writable except for `bob` and that it is ok for guests to login.

```nohighlight
[global]
  # ...
  guest account = nobody
```

Which defines the account to use when authenticating guests. Donâ€™t forget to create this user using `smbpasswd -an nobody`. This will create the user with no password.

```nohighlight
[global]
  #...
  map to guest = bad user
```

This maps any unknown username to the specified guest user, so login always succeeds.

## Useful commands

* `sudo service smbd restart` - restarts samba server (reloads config)
* `smbpasswd -an nobody` - creates user with no password in smb
* `addgroup groupname` - creates new group
* `adduser username` - creates new user
* `usermod -a -G groupname username` - adds existing user to existing group
* `deluser username` - deletes user
* `chown -R :groupname path` - changes group of file/directory
