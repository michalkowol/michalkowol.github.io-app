## Agile vs Waterfall

![Agile vs Waterfall](/img/agile/agile-vs-waterfall.png)

## Co to jest Agile

* Agile is a framework of values and principles to manage teams and projects.
* Agile is an alternative approach to tradicional project managment.
* Jesli widzimy postęp to lepiej się pracuje.
* Jeśli procesy są dobrze zdefiniowane, to wszyscy się lepiej odnajdują.

## Manifest

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Zamiast robić skomplikowany ticket dla innego zespołu, lepiej pójść pogadać.

> Working software over comprehensive documentation

> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Czasami trudno to wdrożyć, ale się da.

> Responding to change over following a plan

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

1. We follow these principles: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
1. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
1. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
1. **Build projects around motivated individuals.** Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
1. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
1. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
1. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
1. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
1. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
1. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
1. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Why Agile <sup>[source](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jmeier/2014/06/03/why-agile/)<sup>

I thought I had written about “Why Agile” before, but I don’t see anything crisp enough.

Anyway, here’s my latest rundown on Why Agile?

1. Increase customer involvement which can build empathy and avoid rework
1. Learn faster which means you can adapt to change
1. Improve quality through focus
1. Reduce risk through shorter feedback loops and customer interaction
1. Simplify by getting rid of overhead and waste
1. Reduce cycle time through timeboxing and parallel development
1. Improve operational awareness through transparency
1. Drive process improvement through continuous improvement
1. Empower people through less mechanics and more interaction, continuous learning, and adaptation
1. Flow more value through more frequent releases and less “big bang”

Remember that nature favors the flexible and agility is the key to success.

## Scrum

### Role

* Product Owner
* Development Team
* Scrum Master

### Activities

* **Project planning**: The initial planning for your project. Project planning includes creating a product vision statement and a product roadmap, and can take place in as little time as one day. Project planning is a common agile practice but is not a scrum activity.
* **Release planning**: Planning the next set of product features to release and identifying an imminent product launch date around which the team can mobilize. On agile projects, you plan one release at a time. Although release planning is referred to in scrum, it is a common agile practice, not an official scrum activity.
* **Sprint**: A short cycle of development in which the team creates potentially shippable product functionality. Sprints, sometimes called iterations, typically last between one and four weeks. Sprints can last as little as one day but should not be longer than four weeks. Sprint length can change during the project, but velocity will be impacted by the duration change.
* **Sprint planning**: A meeting at the beginning of each sprint where the scrum team commits to a sprint goal. They also identify the requirements that support this goal and will be part of the sprint, and the individual tasks it will take to complete each requirement.
* **Daily scrum**: A 15-minute meeting held each day in a sprint. Here development team members coordinate on the priorities of the day, stating what they completed the day before, what they will focus on the current day, and whether they have any roadblocks.
* **Sprint review**: A meeting at the end of each sprint, introduced by the product owner, where the development team demonstrates the working product functionality it completed during the sprint.
* **Sprint retrospective**: A meeting at the end of each sprint, where the scrum team discusses what went well, what could change, and how to make any changes.

### Artifacts

* Product Backlog
* Sprint Backlog
* Burn-Down Chart
* Increment

## Kanban

1. Visualize the Workflow
1. Limit WUP (Work in Progress)
1. Measure the Lead Time



### Pytania

* Kto może zamkykać zadania? Co jeśli PO jest chory?
* Kryteria akceptacyjne
* Wcześniejsze zamykanie zdań
* Źle opisane hitorie (przecież to oczywiste)
* Co jeśli zespołł jest zablokowany, a PO jest np. w Stanach i musi się obudzić
* Hangout - offtop
* Modyfikacja scruma od samego początku

## The short-list

1. Personalized process that's adaptable.
1. Self organization
1. Customer focus / customer connection
1. People centic over doc centric
1. Embracing changes versus figing it
Parint up on problems
1. Reducing the risk of failure
1. Shorter feedback loops
1. Continious build
1. Continous values

## Gra

Ballpassing game

## Transforming into Agile

### Resistance

* Formalists - lubię po staremu
* Enjoying non productive
* Not too much self-driven
