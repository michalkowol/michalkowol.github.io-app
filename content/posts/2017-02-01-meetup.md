## How to organize meetup

### Time

In most cases 6:30PM is ok.

### Event desc

* One line - what?
* For whom
* Agenda - not obligatory
* Sing-up form + expectations! - eventbrite or google form (eventbrite is better)

### Promotion

* Eventbride
* Facebook
* Linkedin
* meetup.com - maybe it is good idea to redirect users from meetup do eventbrite
* startup digest
* add 30-40% tickets - if there is 50 sits in the room, we should "sell" 70 tickets

### Before event

* Send a reminder
* Underline it's important to cancel if you're not coming
* check people's expectations
* Check equipments
* do a rehearsal with speakers (optional)

### After event

Send a survey 24hrs after the event
