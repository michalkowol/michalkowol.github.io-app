## Why

* Let's say you are looking for developer - if you are looking only in Warsaw your options are limited, but when you look for talent in whole county you have much more options

## Divers

* People tend to surrender themselves with people that are similar to them,  but we should try to choose people who think differently
* Team should be divers - not only in terms of skills, but also in personality, politicial etc. - diversity brings values - think diffrently
* When I surrand myself with similar people, you always have to lead. Wehn team is divers it easiers to say "I don't know"
* Diversity: if you work efficiently under pressure, it does not mean everybody like to work under pressure
* As a lead you have to be a buffer - you should not add extra pressure
* Teammeber: "What should I do?"; Lead "What do you think you should work on?" - not parent-child relationship, but rather partner-partner relationship


## Tools

* Right tools for right situation

## Notes

* Always look for chanhce to meet in person (of course if team member also likes to meet)
* Recpect and Trust - very important in remote, divers, disparse team
