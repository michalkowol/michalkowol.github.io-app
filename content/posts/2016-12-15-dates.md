## Wall time <sup>[3](http://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/03/19/persisting_future_datetimes.html)</sup>

Instead of saving the time in UTC along with the time zone, developers can save what the user expects us to save: the wall time. Ie. what the clock on the wall will say. In the example that would be 10:00. And we also save the timezone (Santiago/Chile). This way we can convert back to UTC or any other timezone.

## Rule of thumb <sup>[3](http://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/03/19/persisting_future_datetimes.html)</sup>

What if you are not saving a future time for a meeting? As a rule of thumb: events that have happened in the recent past can safely be saved as UTC. Examples are timestamps for when an email has been sent or a database record has been saved. Your system knows the time in UTC and can save it in UTC. And later you can always convert it to any other time zone.

But in the case of future datetimes such as meetings: converting to UTC and saving UTC + timezone name is not resistant to changes in time zone rules. And remember, time zone rules change all the time.

## Test case

Background: on 26th of March 2017 in Poland we switch to DST.

1. Event creator on 22nd of of March 2017 adds new event in Warsaw for 29th of March 2017 and schedule it for 10:00AM.
1. Event creator on 22nd of of March 2017 adds new event in Warsaw for 26th of March 2017 and schedule it for 02:30AM (old time).
1. Event creator on 22nd of of March 2017 adds new event in Warsaw for 26th of March 2017 and schedule it for 02:30AM (new time).

### Incorrect

Scenario: UTC conversion was made on 22nd and on 24th (hypothetically) Polish Government decided not to use DST anymore. Dates are incorrect.

| Event time in UTC     | Event Location |

### Almost correct

| 2017-03-29 | 10:00:00.000    | Europe/Warsaw  |
| 2017-03-26 | 02:30:00.000    | Europe/Warsaw  |
| 2017-03-26 | 02:30:00.000    | Europe/Warsaw  |

### Correct

| Event wall time | Event Location |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| 2017-03-29T10:00:00.000+02:00 | Europe/Warsaw  |
| 2017-03-26T02:30:00.000+01:00 | Europe/Warsaw  |
| 2017-03-26T02:30:00.000+02:00 | Europe/Warsaw  |

| Event date | Event wall time | Event UTC offset | Event Location |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 2017-03-29 | 10:00:00.000    | +02:00           | Europe/Warsaw  |

### UTC Offset

(...) To avoid ambigiuty we also save a third piece of data: the UTC offset. (...) <sup>[3](http://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/03/19/persisting_future_datetimes.html)</sup>

TL;DR: In autumn, clocks could be set back from 3:00 to 2:00. 2:30 happens twice.

Question on [ycombinator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9251358):

> Why store the UTC offset too, then? Couldn't you get that with the timezone? Then you've got the wall time for the meeting saved, and if you need to convert it to UTC for some reason, you could do it with the most current rules for the timezone.
If the offset becomes meaningless in the event of a rule change anyway, why save it when the most current rules will help you get the offset?

Answer:
 	
> Good question!
It is optional to store the UTC offset. The reason to store the UTC offset is to avoid ambiguity there might be when the timezone rules do not change.
If the timezone rules don't change and you happen to be storing a datetime that is during changing from DST to non-DST, you specify which specific time you are talking about. In autumn, clocks could be set back from 3:00 to 2:00. 2:30 happens twice. When you schedule the time you can ask the user "2:30 summer time or 2:30 winter time"?
So you only use the offset for anything in rare case there is an ambiguity (usually because of going off of DST), otherwise you just ignore it. In most cases even if the rules change like in the Chile example you would ignore it as well and use the offset provided by the timezone database.
